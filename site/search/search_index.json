This application aims to improve your audio experience when talking to your friends or colleagues over any device. The Decibull App seamlessly integrates onto your device and can be added as an extension on your browser or installed via play store. Motivation When audio data is streamed through the internet on platforms such as Zoom, the audio is compressed before transmission. This allows for faster loading times, meaning that you internet does not have to be as fast to receive the information in real time. However, this also means that the quality of the audio is reduced. More specifically, the audio is sampled less frequently (like with lower frame rates on videos), and the highest frequencies of audio are removed altogether. In extreme cases, this can make audio sound like it is underwater. This is where DeciBull can help. DeciBull will take audio data coming in, and transform it using machine learning. Our algorithm will detect where audio information is missing, and work to fill in the gaps. The result is audio with a higher frequency range and sampling rate, which will sound clearer and more crisp to the human ear. DeciBull can upsample audio in real time, so there will be no additional lag when used with live-streamed audio.","title":"About DeciBull"},{"location":"About/#about-decibull","text":"DeciBull was developed as a capstone project at UC Berkeley's MIDS program.

This concept of generating super resolution audio is borrowed from generating super resolution images using GANs. A GAN comprises of two models i.e. a generator and a discriminator model which are used to resolve missing details in images/audio to generate super resolution images/audio from low quality images. Our work is inspired by existing research done to use GANs in generating super resolution audio. However most of the research has been focused on generating batch high resolution audio. In our approach we are attempting to generate real time super resolution audio using GANs.","title":"How it works"},{"location":"How/#how-it-works","text":"We generate high quality audio i.e. super-resolution audio from the low quality audio from your device by using General Adversarial networks (GANs).
