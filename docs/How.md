# How it works

Our propietary algorithm uses neural nets to process incoming audio signals from an application and upsample to generate higher quality audio and transmit it to the end user to improve their experience. 
We borrow the idea of super resolution from image upsampling and apply it on audio signals to generate higher quality audio signals.
